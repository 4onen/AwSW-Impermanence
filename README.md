# AwSW-Impermanence

An Angels with Scaly Wings mods to allow the player to reneg on many consequential decisions that, in the base game, were locked after they were first made correctly.

<br/>

Implemented thus far, without spoilers:

+ Disables the *Enlightened* card after the True Ending has been played at least once. Can be re-enabled by a Mod Settings menu option.
+ Adine's death
+ Bryce's death
+ Remy's death
+ Sebastian's death
+ Vara's death

<br/>

<details>
<summary>Detailed conditions</summary>

+ Adine's death will now occur if you are not there to talk her down, or Remy is not on his good ending path.
+ Bryce's death can now occur as normal if you choose incorrectly, whether or not his good ending has been played.
+ Remy's death will occur if they are "Bad" or "Abandoned" at the critical moment. The player will also not have the option to start Remy's good ending path on a save file if they have not met the basegame conditions (looked at Remy's pictures or played Adine's second date) regardless of whether the player has played Remy's good ending. Vara must be alive for Remy's good ending.
+ Sebastian will die if you do not suggest he watch the fireworks. This is no longer a forced choice.
+ If killer mode is enabled, Vara will die if not explicitly saved on a given run, regardless of whether she has been saved previously.
